## **FuelFeed ( DoomScroll Antidote )** üî•

FuelFeed is a social media platform designed to break the cycle of mindless doomscrolling and inspire users to take control of their lives. Unlike traditional platforms that often serve distracting or low-value content, FuelFeed curates a feed centered around self-improvement, motivation, discipline, and purpose.
</br>

The app is built to ignite a spark within users, encouraging them to reflect, take action, and build better habits. To reinforce this mission, FuelFeed limits usage to 45-minute sessions, followed by a mandatory 2-hour cooldown, ensuring users engage intentionally rather than compulsively.
</br>

Inspired by platforms like Facebook in structure, but opposite in philosophy, FuelFeed isn‚Äôt about endless scrolling, it‚Äôs about fueling the mind, not draining it.

## <span style="color: red;">**FAQ's** ü§î</span>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£. **Why FuelFeed is different from other social media applicatons?**

Most social media platforms are designed to keep users glued to their screens, often leading to hours of doomscrolling and wasted time chasing quick dopamine hits.
</br>
FuelFeed takes a completely different approach:

- Its core mission is to inspire users in a positive way by showing content that sparks motivation and action.
- Only content related to self-improvement, discipline, productivity, and personal growth is allowed.
- No drama. No clickbait. No distractions.
- Just real, uplifting content shared by users who want to grow and help others grow too.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£. **How does FuelFeed monitor the content posted on the feed?**

To maintain the quality and purpose of the platform, FuelFeed includes a **Report Post** feature.

- Users can report posts that don‚Äôt match motivational content.
- This helps us quickly identify and take action against particular content.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£. **How is this project different from the previously developed project, **[QuillQuest](https://quill-quest-tau.vercel.app/)**?**

Both projects differ in features and purpose, FuelFeed demonstrates significant improvements in development although.
</br>
Key differences include:

- FuelFeed was developed using only about 32% of the backend requests compared to QuillQuest.
- This shows we‚Äôve gotten better at organizing and streamlining our backend work.
- It reflects improvement in building things in a faster and cleaner way.
